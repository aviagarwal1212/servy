= Introduction

In this report, we will explore the various factors that influence fluid dynamics in _glaciers_ and how they contribute to the formation and behaviour of these natural structures:
+ The climate
    - Temperature
+ The topography
+ The geology

But most commonly, the flow rate of the glacier is defined by the following equation: $Q = rho A v + "time offset"$.

$ 7.32 beta + sum_(i=0)^nabla (Q_i (a_i - epsilon))/2 $

$ v := vec(x_1, x_2, x_3) $
